# PredictBusiness-opportunities


The goal of the "Business Opportunity Prediction" repository is to provide a machine learning model that predicts which business opportunities are more likely to win, using data integration from multiple sources. The repository will include scripts for cleaning and integrating data from various sources, as well as code for building and training the predictive model. The model will use various machine learning algorithms to analyze data such as customer behavior, market trends, and financial data to predict the likelihood of success for each business opportunity. The repository will be useful for businesses and organizations looking to improve their sales forecasting and increase their success rate in winning new business.
